# Trajectory

The Trajectory repository hosts a microservice and client webapp for Trajectory.

# Solution architecture

The solution is composed of:
- **ModelSharedIn**
  - contains C# auto-generated classes of Model dependencies
  - these dependencies are stored as json files (following the OpenApi standard) and C# classes are generated on execution of the program
  - *dependencies* = some external microservices (OpenApi schemas in json format)
- **Model**
  - defines the main classes and methods to run the microservice
  - *dependencies* = BaseModels
- **Service**
  - defines the proper microservice API
  - *dependencies* = Model
- **ModelSharedOut**
  - contains C# auto-generated classes for microservice clients dependencies
  - these dependencies are stored as json files (following the OpenAPI standard) and C# classes are generated on execution of the program
  - these dependencies include the OpenApi schema of the microservice itself as well as other dependencies that may be useful to run the microservice
  - *dependencies* = Trajectory.json + some external microservices (OpenApi schemas in json format)
- **ModelTest**
  - performs unit tests on the Model (in particular for base computations)
  - *dependencies* = Model
- **ServiceTest**
  - microservice client that performs unit tests on the microservice (by default, an instance of the microservice must be running on http port 8080 to run tests)
  - *dependencies* = ModelShared
- **WebApp**
  - microservice web app client that manages data associated with Trajectory and allow to interact with the microservice
  - *dependencies* = ModelShared
- **home** (auto-generated)
  - data are persisted in the microservice container using the Sqlite database located at *home/Trajectory.db*

# Security/Confidentiality

Data are persisted as clear text in a unique Sqlite database hosted in the docker container.
Neither authentication nor authorization have been implemented.
Would you like or need to protect your data, docker containers of the microservice and webapp are available on dockerhub, under the digiwells organization, at:

https://hub.docker.com/?namespace=digiwells

More info on how to run the container and map its database to a folder on your computer, at:

# Deployment

Microservice is available at:

https://dev.digiwells.no/Trajectory/api/Trajectory

https://app.digiwells.no/Trajectory/api/Trajectory

Web app is available at:

https://dev.digiwells.no/Trajectory/webapp/Trajectory

https://app.digiwells.no/Trajectory/webapp/Trajectory

The OpenApi schema of the microservice is available and testable at:

https://dev.digiwells.no/Trajectory/swagger (development server) 

https://app.digiwells.no/Trajectory/swagger (production server)

The microservice and webapp are deployed as Docker containers using Kubernetes and Helm. More info at:
